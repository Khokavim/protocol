# protocol

The protocol was built on the Ethereum blockchain using the smart contract language Solidity. <br>
The decentralized storage - IPFS component uses the https://infura.io node for hosting files on the IPFS network. <br> 
Web3.js is used for the frontend to interact with "contract Littafi". <br>
The Contract source code can be verified here at https://etherscan.io/address/0xabb2030ed43d1a881b7ed5cdc9fb192ee94c87f4#code<br>

As a decentralised application (dapp), you need an ethereum client/wallet to interact with the protocol at https://littafi.io <br>

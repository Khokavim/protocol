# protocol

The protocol was built on the Ethereum blockchain using the smart contract language Solidity. The decentralized storage - IPFS component uses the https://infura.io node for hosting files on the IPFS network. Web3.js is used for the frontend to interact with "contract Littafi". The Contract source code can be verified here at https://etherscan.io/address/0xabb2030ed43d1a881b7ed5cdc9fb192ee94c87f4#code
